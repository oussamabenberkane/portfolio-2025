# React + Vite

This is my personal portfolio website, built with React and Vite.


## Docker Deployment

To build and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t portfolio-app .
    ```
2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5173:5173 portfolio-app
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
3.  **Stop the Docker container:**
    To stop the running container, first find its ID:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    Then, stop it using the ID:
    ```bash
    docker stop <container_id>
    ```
